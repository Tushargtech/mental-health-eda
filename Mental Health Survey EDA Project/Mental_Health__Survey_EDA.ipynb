        "The dataset analyzed originates from a 2014 mental health survey conducted within the tech industry. It comprises responses from 1,259 individuals across various demographic and workplace backgrounds. The dataset explores topics like family history of mental illness, workplace mental health support, anonymity, treatment-seeking behavior, and perceived consequences of discussing mental health at work.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) was to understand behavioral trends and workplace patterns that influence how employees address mental health concerns. The UBM (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate) method was used to extract insights.\n",
        "\n",
        " During preprocessing, we corrected major outliers and cleaned gender responses into standard categories (Male, Female, Other). We also handled inconsistent or non-numeric age entries and removed unrealistic values (<18 and >65).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the univariate analysis phase, we found:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Majority of respondents were Male and aged between 25–35.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Significant work interference due to mental health issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Limited awareness about employer-provided mental health benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A considerable number of employees reported lack of trust in anonymity when seeking help.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bivariate analysis highlighted the relationships between treatment and features like gender, age, remote work status, and company size:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Female respondents were slightly more likely to seek treatment than males.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Employees in larger companies were more likely to be aware of mental health benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Remote workers showed treatment-seeking patterns slightly different from non-remote employees.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multivariate analysis included correlation heatmaps and pair plots. Categorical variables were encoded for a correlation matrix, revealing weak to moderate relationships between family history, treatment, and work structure. The pair plot visually confirmed the relationships between age, gender, and treatment behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "From these analyses, we identified major themes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lack of mental health support is still prevalent.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Stigma prevents open conversations about mental health.\n",
        "\n",
        "- There is inadequate training among supervisors to handle such discussions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Companies often fail to communicate policies clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the findings, here are strategic business recommendations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Improve Awareness:** Employers must regularly communicate about mental health benefits and support resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Build Trust:** Ensure anonymity and confidentiality when employees seek mental health help.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Supervisor Training:** Equip leaders with the skills to respond to mental health concerns empathetically.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tailored Wellness Programs:** Customize initiatives based on age, gender, remote work, and family history.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Equal Treatment:** Align mental health policies to match those for physical health in accessibility and importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis emphasizes that mental health is not a one-size-fits-all issue. Proactive, inclusive, and well-communicated support systems are essential to create healthier tech workplaces. Implementing these strategies can reduce stigma, enhance productivity, and improve employee retention.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates the power of structured EDA in uncovering actionable insights from real-world behavioral datasets.\n",
        "\n",
